# This is the DN of the "user" account with which to bind to the directory.
# It is commonly supplied by the LDAP admins. For notational shorthand, 
# there are abbreviations in the DN (Distinguished Name) of this user, here
# are a few:
# ou = Organizational Unit (e.g. department)
# o = Organization
# dc = Domain Component (e.g. "com" in "company.com")
# uid = User ID
# cn = Common Name

# Where in the tree should Splunk start looking for groups? Child objects below
# this will be searched, so this should be the "root" or "greatest common
# component" of the LDAP path to the collection of groups to be mapped to
# Splunk. If there are multiple paths (as large organizations are likely
# to have), then multiple paths, separated by semicolons, can be used.

# This maps groups to roles in Splunk. See also authorize.conf.
# In order to log in, a user must
#   exist in the directory
#   provide the correct password
#   be a member of a group that has been mapped to a Splunk role
# This is one way to manage users by sharing the same LDAP configuration
# across multiple search heads, but limiting the roleMap entries only to
# the LDAP groups which are permitted to log in.
# If multiple LDAP groups exist on the RHS of the mapping, they should
# be separated by semicolons. NOTE: Attempting to map multiple groups to 
# the same role by providing multiple key=value pairs with the same Splunk
# role listed as the key will NOT work.
