# SEARCH HEAD VOLUME SETTINGS
# In this example, the volume spec is only here to satisfy the
# "volume:<name>" tag in the indexes.conf. Indexes are shared between
# indexers and search heads, even though SH are not indexing any data
# locally. The SH uses this index list to validate the target of summary
# indexed data in the UI, or to provide typeahead for users trying to
# search for "index=...".
# In this instance, we do *not* use a maxVolumeDataSizeMB, because it
# doesn't matter.
